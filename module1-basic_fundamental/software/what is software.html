<!-- what is software ?
 
Software is a set of instructions that tells a computer or other device how to perform a task.

It enables usres to interact with devices in ways that would otherwise be impossible, such as creating graphics, editing videos, and playing games.

The term "software" was coined to distinguish these instructions from the physical components of a computer, which are known as hardware.

Software can be thought of as the variable part of a computer, while hardwares is the invariable part.
