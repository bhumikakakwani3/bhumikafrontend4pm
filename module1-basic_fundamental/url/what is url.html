<!-- what is URL ?
 
A URL, or Uniform Resource Locator, is a unique identifier that points to a resource on the internet, such as a web page or file.

URLs are also known as web addresses.

URLs are made up of multiple parts, including a protocol and domain name, that tell web browsers how to find a resource.

There are two types of URL

(A) absolute URL :
Absolute URLs use the full address, including scheme and authority.

(B) Reltive URL :
Relative URLs don't include the scheme or authority because they point to a location within an already accessed URL.
